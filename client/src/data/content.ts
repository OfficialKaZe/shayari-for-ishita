Like stars that dance in cosmic ways,
In your eyes I see my home,
With you, I'm never alone,

It's in the little things each day,

It makes the strongest person weep,
But from the ashes we can rise,
With wisdom gleaming in our eyes,
Some lessons hurt, but ours to keep.`,

In golden light and gentle rays,
Sweet memories that time can't steal,
Moments that still make us feel,

Like rainfall on a thirsty land,
You always lend a helping hand,
With grace and beauty you astound.`,

Your faith in me helps me believe,
That every dream I can achieve,
With you, no bridge cannot be crossed.`,

Etched in my heart, no distance mars,
Each constellation spells your name,
My feelings burn like sacred flame,
You heal my deepest hidden scars.`,

Authentic, caring, loving, true,
In a world that's sometimes fake,
You're real for real friendship's sake,
I'm blessed to share this life with you.`
